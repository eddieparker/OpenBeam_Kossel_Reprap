# Kossel Pro Rep Rap (Eddie's Version)

I'm building a Kossel Pro Rep Rap, and I wanted a place to manage the various 3D printable, lasercut, and miscellaneous documents.

In here are items from Terence Tam's OpenBeam Kossel Reprap [1] repository, Philetus' bottery_kossel_mini [2] repository, some of my own creations, and likely other places as well.

Let me know if you have any questions.
